RomWBW Emulator - Remaining Tasks
==================================

Status: CLI version works. WebAssembly version needs testing.

Completed:
----------
- Split off from ~/src/cpmemu - DONE
- CLI version builds and runs using installed qkz80 library
- Updated web/Makefile to use qkz80 sources from cpmemu for WASM build

Remaining Tasks:
----------------

1. BUILD AND TEST WEBASSEMBLY VERSION
   - Log in as user with emscripten installed
   - cd web && make romwbw.js
   - Test with: make serve-romwbw (opens http://localhost:8080)
   - Load romwbw.html and test with emu_romwbw.rom or SBC_simh_std.rom
   - Debug memory bank switching issues mentioned in previous notes

2. VERIFY ALL OSes BOOT
   - At boot prompt, test each OS option:
     - 0 (ROM disk boot)
     - C (CP/M)
     - Z (ZSDOS)
   - Ensure boot ROM prompt works in both CLI and WebAssembly

3. REFACTOR SHARED CODE (if not already done)
   - Memory bank code is in romwbw_mem.h (shared)
   - HBIOS dispatch is in hbios_dispatch.cc (shared)
   - I/O abstraction is in emu_io.h with emu_io_cli.cc / emu_io_wasm.cc
   - Verify the factoring is complete and both versions use same core

4. OPTIONAL: Make QKZ80_SRC path in web/Makefile configurable
   - Currently hardcoded to /home/wohl2/src/cpmemu/src
   - Could use environment variable or local.mk override

Notes:
------
- CLI emulator: ./src/romwbw_emu --romwbw roms/emu_romwbw.rom
- Console escape: Ctrl+E
- Boot help: press H at boot prompt
